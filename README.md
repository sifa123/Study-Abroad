# Study Abroad
"Study Abroad" is a type of website that allows you to search for your dream institution in your dream nation to pursue a Bachelor's, Master's, or Ph.D. degree.
## Background
This Project will have three pages: a home page, a contact page, and a page with nations where you can explore the universities of Asia (Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, etc.), and Europe (Germany, Italy, France, etc.). You'll find categories like Asia, Europe, England, North America, and others on the countries page. Then, if you click on Asia, you'll find a list of all the countries that make up Asia, and you may choose your desired country to browse a list of institutions offering various programs.
This page will be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
